 Notes

## Description

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3` etc.

For example, the score of `abad` is `8` (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

## Domain

    - a = 1
    - b = 2
    - c = 3
    - ...
- return the highest scoring word (as string)
- tie: return word that appear earliest
